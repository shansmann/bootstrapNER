# bootstrapNER

This project aims at bootstrapping NER for novel entities using distant supervision. Training datasets will be created 
using the Microsoft concept graph in a weakly supervised manner. 

NER architecture is based on the work by Ma and Hovy 
"End-to-end Sequence Labeling via Bi-directional LSTM-CNNs-CRF" as well as Lample et al. "Neural Architectures 
for Named Entity Recognition".
